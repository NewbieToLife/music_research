# music_research

Code for music research project.
Questions that need answering: 
- Is it better to count the number of consonant and dissonant intervals or just atribute a score
that sums a positive value for consonant and a negative value for dissonant interval?
Score benefits variability but makes the music more difficult to control via genetic reprodution.
